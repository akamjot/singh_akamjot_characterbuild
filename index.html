<h3 class="lb_heading">Eren Yeager - Founding Titan</h3>

<p class="lb_text">
  Eren Yeager (エレン・イェーガー) was a former member of the Survey Corps. He was the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan. This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.

</p>

<p class="lb_text">
  Eren Yeager aka Founding Titan wiped out the 80 percent of humanity (wanted to wipe out whole humanity) to maintain the balance between the people of the world. He sacrified his mother, his friend and even his love so that the remaining people can live in peace without the presence of titans.

  Mikasa Ackerman (ミカサ・アッカーマン) is one of the two deuteragonists of the series, along with Armin Arlert.

  After her parents were murdered by human traffickers, Mikasa was rescued by Eren Yeager and lived with him and his parents, Grisha and Carla, before the fall of Wall Maria. She is the last descendant of the Shogun clan that stayed on Paradis Island, thereby related to the Azumabito family, and holds significant political power in Hizuru.

  <p class="lb_text">
    Armin Arlelt (アルミン・アルレルト Arumin Arureruto?) is the 15th and current commander (団長) of the Scout Regiment. He is also a childhood friend of Eren Jaeger and Mikasa Ackermann, and is one of the two deuteragonists of the series. Although he appears to be the physically weakest of the 104th Cadet Corps, his high intelligence and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset, though he does not consider himself to be one and is known to have low self-esteem. After the battle of Shiganshina District, he took the power of the Titans from Bertholdt Hoover and became the Colossal Titan.
